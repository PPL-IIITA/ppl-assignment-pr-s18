-------------For question 3------------
ques 2 using inheritance is in 3.cpp
to view gifts exchanged and happy and compatible couples, open file Happiness_compatibility_gift.txt
(k is being taken as an input)
->g++ 3.cpp libphase2.a
->./a.out

-------------For question 4------------
Breakup was done for least k happy couples and new couples were allocated
(k is being taken as an input)
To view the new couples so formed after breakups open file couple4.txt
->g++ 4.cpp libphase2.a
->./a.out

-------------For question 5------------
The choice between allotment algorithm of the gifts is randomly generated in the main function i.e. 5.cpp
(k is being taken as an input)
To view this answer open file new_couple.txt
->g++ 5.cpp libphase2.a
->./a.out


-------------For question 6------------
Gifting days and t are randomly generated (6.cpp)
To view the new couples so formed after breakups and allocation open file ques6.txt
->g++ 6.cpp libphase2.a
->./a.out

-------------For question 7------------
The list of the boys is randomly generated through a function in implement.h
The choice between searching algorithm of the girlfriend is randomly generated in function in implement.h
The default mechanism is normal array implementation
To view the girlfriend of the boys, open file ques7.txt
->g++ 7.cpp libphase2.a
->./a.out


-------------For question 8------------
The choice between the gifting algorithm is generated randomly in the function in giftSelector.h
To view the gift exchanges that took place between couples open file ques8.txt
->g++ 8.cpp libphase2.a
